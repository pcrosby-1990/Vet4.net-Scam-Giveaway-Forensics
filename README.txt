On December 19, 2020, a total of 751,670 VET (VeChain Tokens) were illicitly transferred from a source wallet (WALLET_4) into the Binance 1 Hot Wallet, a high-volume exchange address. Within minutes, the funds were rapidly dispersed into multiple laundering clusters, including wallets 0xE0c37c735f230F58c16d8BA0f8dfb2f059499802 and 0x6471638bd0d15f430757E0407837149B5377053b. These clusters exhibited classic laundering behaviors: fan-out dispersals, elevated gas usage, and cross-chain swaps designed to obscure the asset trail. The incident highlights systemic laundering tactics and the urgent need for forensic readiness and AML enforcement across digital asset platforms.
