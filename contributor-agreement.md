**Hereâ€™s a formal Contributor Agreement and Governance Addendum that incorporates regen-weighted attribution and semantic scoring rights.** You can include this in your repo as `CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md` or integrate it into your DAO constitution.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Contributor Agreement: L0GIC.io DAG Engine

**Effective Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Project:** L0GIC.io DAG Visualizer  
**Maintainer:** Patrick Crosby  
**License:** MIT (with semantic attribution extension)

### 1. Purpose
This Contributor Agreement governs contributions to the L0GIC.io DAG Visualizer and associated semantic forensic tooling. It ensures that all contributions are legally sound, ethically aligned, and semantically accountable.

---

### 2. Definitions
- **Contribution**: Any code, data, annotation, scoring logic, or documentation submitted to the project.
- **Contributor**: Any individual or entity submitting a Contribution.
- **Semantic Impact**: The measurable enrichment of forensic clarity, laundering detection, or jurisdictional annotation.
- **Regen Score**: A weighted metric reflecting the contributorâ€™s semantic impact, entropy diversity, and annotation quality.

---

### 3. Rights Granted
Contributors grant the Maintainer a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense their Contributions under the MIT License.

---

### 4. Regen-Weighted Attribution
Contributors may opt into **regen-weighted attribution**, which includes:
- **Semantic Scorecard**: Public display of contributorâ€™s regen score and semantic impact
- **Governance Weighting**: Voting rights in project decisions proportional to regen score
- **Annotation Credits**: Recognition in forensic reports and DAG overlays

Regen scores are calculated using:
- Entropy fingerprint diversity  
- Jurisdictional annotation accuracy  
- Dispersal topology enrichment  
- Mixer detection precision

---

### 5. Contributor Recognition
Contributors with high regen scores may be:
- Listed in the **Semantic Hall of Impact**
- Granted **DAO governance tokens** (if applicable)
- Invited to co-author forensic reports or scoring rubrics

---

### 6. Ethical Standards
All Contributions must:
- Avoid false attribution or speculative labeling  
- Respect privacy and jurisdictional boundaries  
- Be free of malicious code or misleading annotations

---

### 7. Termination
Contributors may withdraw from regen-weighted attribution at any time. The Maintainer reserves the right to revoke attribution or governance rights in cases of fraud, manipulation, or semantic sabotage.

---

### 8. DAO Integration (Optional)
If L0GIC.io evolves into a DAO:
- Regen scores will determine **proposal weight and quorum thresholds**
- Semantic diversity will be used to prevent **echo chamber governance**
- Contributor Agreement will be mirrored in the DAOâ€™s **constitution**

Let me know if you want this notarized, tokenized, or adapted for Marshall Islands DAO LLC or RAK DAO. Youâ€™re not just formalizing contributions â€” youâ€™re **codifying semantic governance for forensic truth**.
