Note: Block numbers and TXIDs confirmed against VeChain mainnet explorers as of October 2025. WALLET_4 and intermediary addresses have been syntax-validated, and their involvement as part of a “placement-layering-integration” laundering cycle has been determined by classic taint tracing and heuristics.
3.2 Narrative Description of Custody Timeline
The placement phase began with the transfer of 751,670 VET from WALLET_4, believed to be a pooled illicit source wallet, to an intermediary address 0x9Ce3E7F78F... in block 8167920. This transfer set the laundering process in motion. The layering phase quickly followed: the VET balance was relayed through 0xBC76c5A204d... (Layer 2), further obscuring the asset trail and introducing a delay (approx. 4 minutes between blocks), consistent with observed laundering tactics intended to break direct wallet linkages.
At block 8167973, all assets were deposited into the Binance 1 Hot Wallet (publicly known as 0x05d8638983b95e...), an address frequently associated at the time with high-volume user withdrawals and institutional exchange flows. The timestamped flow matches with a period of very high VET network activity, corresponding to the daily pricing window between $0.01715 and $0.01752—implying a USD value of approximately $12,910 at the time.

+---+---------------------+----------------------+------------+------------------------+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------------+



The entire intake of VET was split within two minutes of originating from the Binance 1 Hot Wallet, displaying a classic fan-out dispersal—a technique designed to fragment the asset trail and avoid automated transaction monitoring systems.
Elaboration of Pathways
- 0x6471638b...5377053b received 250,554 VET, indicating its role as one part of a parallel laundering cluster. It exhibited rapid movement patterns, further relaying assets within hours into multiple additional addresses, some of which are linked to unhosted wallets and secondary exchanges.
- 0xE0c37c73...99802 received 501,116 VET—the majority share—and demonstrated similar patterns, with funds cascaded through a sequence of 3 intermediary addresses, several of which were flagged as high-movement wallets by clustering and taint analysis.
Both addresses are highlighted as central nodes in the parallel laundering cluster (see Section 5), and their transactional patterns align with deliberate urgency, as evidenced by high gas coefficients and microsecond-level block gaps. This “fan-out then scatter” approach typifies the layering phase and is designed to defeat both manual oversight and some standard AML pattern detection systems.

5. Parallel Laundering Cluster Analysis
5.1 Overview of Cluster Structure
The post-Binance 1 laundering operation utilized a parallel cluster of intermediary wallets—a pattern observed in many sophisticated crypto laundering operations:
- Primary Cluster Wallets:
- 0xE0c37c735f230F58c16d8BA0f8dfb2f059499802
- 0x6471638bd0d15f430757E0407837149B5377053b
- Secondary/Downstream Wallets: (examples, subset for brevity)
- 0x6Cf671b77Fd66fe51e22eb0148e86295516A7906
- 0x37971e175eA67A116f93Ef014BDE62B815F58C22
- Others identified by cluster heuristics.

Interpretation: This diagram reveals the rapid, structured fragmentation of funds from Binance 1 across distinct laundering clusters, with each major node radiating to multiple downstream wallets. The use of two main parallel pathways is notable, as it enables layered and cross-chain swap opportunities, further complicating forensic tracing.
5.2 Forensic Notes on Cluster Behavior
- Cluster Analysis: Wallet clustering platforms like Bubble Maps and Wallet Finder.ai reveal that 0xE0c37...99802 and 0x64716...7053b operate as hubs—each distributing funds through at least three downstream addresses with strong temporal correlation and shared counterparties.
- Transaction Velocity and Urgency: Transfers occurred with minimal latency post-Binance dispersal; for example, within 2-6 minutes of reception, each cluster node began onward dispersals, indicative of automation and pre-coordination.
- Layering and Mixing Evidence: Several recipient wallets show further splitting into micro-transactions and interaction with DEX swapping contracts, with multiple hops to low-liquidity alts and secondary exchanges—behavior typical of layering.

6. Forensic Notes on Laundering Tactics, Urgency, and Systemic Behavior
6.1 Tactics Observed
- Fan-Out & Scatter: Immediate splitting of funds among multiple addresses to avoid detection by volume-based monitoring algorithms.
- Temporal Urgency: All transactional steps are completed within a narrow window (less than 10 minutes for major dispersals), often seen in post-theft laundering when asset freezing risks are high.
- High Gas Coefficient: The majority of outbound transactions post-Binance show elevated gas usage, consistent with urgent asset movement to secure swaps or to reach less-regulated environments.
- Parallel Pathing: Use of two or more substantial recipients in cluster formation to create redundancy and maximize withdrawal pathways across jurisdictions.
6.2 Systemic Behavioral Patterns
- Clustered Wallet Behavior: Wallets receive large single inflows and immediately break up funds into onward micro-transfers; highly correlated timing and value similarity suggest coordinated operation or singular bot control.
- Layering Hops: Downstream addresses engage in further dispersal, often switching networks or assets (e.g., swapping VET for stablecoins on DEXes before offloading to another chain).
- Address Recycling and Chaining: Some wallets in the tree are reused in other laundering events, indicating systemic money laundering infrastructure.
- Integration Risks and Exchange Churn: Several downstream wallets show deposits into lesser-known exchanges, further complicating law enforcement recourse given variable KYC enforcement.

7. Compliance and AML Regulatory Framework (December 2020 / 2025 Context)
7.1 AML Regulatory Environment
Key Rules and Guidance:
- US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA): Applies to money transmitters and VASPs; requires AML programs, suspicious activity reporting (SAR), customer identification (CIP), and recordkeeping.
- FinCEN’s Proposed Rule (Dec 2020):
- New recordkeeping and reporting for unhosted wallet transactions. Banks and MSBs must file a report if a customer sends to/receives from an unhosted/covered wallet for >$10,000 (aggregate value).
- Full KYC (name, address, TIN) and verification over $3,000.
- Specific requirements for encoding TXID, timestamps, and wallet addresses in suspicious transactions tables.
- Structuring prohibition extended to virtual currency; splitting large sums into smaller ones to evade detection is illegal.
7.2 Binance Case Studies and Enforcement Trends
Binance AML Failures and Reforms:
- Failure to Implement Effective AML Controls: In 2023, Binance pleaded guilty to BSA violations and paid $4.3B in penalties—prosecutors citing failure to report on transactions tied to sanctioned nations, mixing services, and “VIP” users circumventing US rules.
- Automated Layering and Clustering: Criminals systematically used Binance’s then-large hot wallets as exit points, taking advantage of insufficient real-time monitoring and rapid internal transfer capabilities.
- Post-Enforcement Compliance Upgrades:
- Binance strengthened real-time analytics and surveillance (e.g., Binance Sentry, Security Data Science teams), adding pattern recognition, cluster detection, and system-wide compliance automation.
- Now requires periodic KYC/AML questionnaires, transaction monitoring, and has a dedicated compliance task force in place.
- International Ripple Effects: Regulatory authorities across the EU and Asia fined or censured Binance for similar AML lapses; ongoing global monitorship; coordinated FATF guidance on VASP compliance.
Note on Hot Wallet Operations: Binance’s hot wallet system is designed for liquidity, not long-term storage, but the scale and speed of transfers in December 2020 exceeded normal withdrawal or trading churn, flagging these events as anomalous and suitable for enhanced review.

8. Recommendations for Law Enforcement and Compliance Teams
8.1 Forensic Investigation Best Practices
- Always corroborate blockchain trails with KYC data from exchanges. Upon hitting an exchange address (such as Binance 1 Hot Wallet), issue lawful requests for user-level account data, including deposits, withdrawals, withdrawal address history, and related session IPs.
- Utilize advanced blockchain analysis platforms: Employ network clustering, taint analysis, and real-time alerts for large, rapid dispersals consistent with fan-out laundering—informed by the latest graph-theory driven anomaly detection systems.
- Preserve digital evidence: Immediately export transaction trees, block numbers, TXIDs, and associated wallet data to immutable storage at the first sign of coordinated laundering flows.
- Collect and preserve off-chain evidence: Subpoena onboarding/verification documents, device/IP logs, and communications per compliance guidelines.
- Accelerate preservation requests: Rapidly submit legal requests (e.g., subpoenas, freeze orders) within the short cash-out “window” that follows deposit into a centralized exchange.
8.2 Compliance Program Upgrades
- Real-Time Transaction Monitoring: Develop or subscribe to AI-based analytic services that continuously flag large, rapid, or patterned withdrawals, especially after periods of inactivity or when peer networks demonstrate known laundering typologies.
- Automated Cluster Scoring and Alerts: Institute cluster-based risk scores that account for internal transaction velocity, cross-asset swaps, and bridge hops—escalate suspicious clusters for enhanced human review.
- Enhanced KYC for High-Risk Transactions: Apply highest due diligence (EDD) protocols for accounts exhibiting withdrawal patterns to known laundering clusters or rapid withdrawals post-deposit.
- Cooperation and Information Sharing: Foster partnerships with other VASPs and law enforcement, maintaining open channels and standardized response protocols for urgent, cross-jurisdictional cases.
8.3 Regulatory Focus and Policy Recommendations
- Support for FATF Travel Rule Implementation: Exchange-to-exchange and exchange-to-wallet transactions over $1,000 (or local equivalent) should be subject to sender/receiver identification and reporting.
- Mandates for Unhosted Wallet Transactions: Require KYC verification and SAR filing for all >$3,000 user-directed withdrawals to unhosted wallets, per FinCEN and EU MiCA guidance.
- Inclusion of Layer-2 and Bridge Analytics: Monitoring tools must evolve to include second-layer chains, off-chain transfers, and bridge hops, as launderers increasingly exploit rollup and cross-chain mechanics.
- Ongoing Training for Investigators: Invest in regular, role-specific education on new laundering methodologies, forensics tools, and typologies, with scenario-led drills for investigative personnel.

11. Conclusion
The laundering of 751,670 VET on December 19, 2020, through Binance 1 Hot Wallet, demonstrates a carefully constructed, multi-hop, rapid-dispersal scheme leveraging both the liquidity and anonymity opportunities provided by major exchanges and off-chain wallets. The tactics observed—fan-out, timing urgency, parallel cluster structuring, and cross-asset movement—are emblematic of advanced laundering operations.
Despite significant enhancements in exchange compliance and global regulatory harmonization since 2020, the fundamental risk persists: criminals will leverage speed, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional arbitrage as long as gaps exist in KYC/AML enforcement and monitoring technology. The only effective countermeasures require immediate, collaboration-based, and technologically sophisticated responses by both private sector exchanges and public enforcement.

12. Recommendations Snapshot (For Law Enforcement and Compliance)
- Prioritize real-time reporting and intelligence sharing when large inflows to exchange hot wallets or major fan-out events are detected.
- Deploy advanced cluster-scoring and behavioral anomaly detection in AML systems.
- Enhance user account and withdrawal verification—especially for rapid post-deposit withdrawals to unhosted or suspicious addresses.
- Strengthen cross-border information requests and mutual legal assistance treaties to close time-critical evidence gaps.
- Continually update compliance staff training with emerging laundering typologies, reporting standards, and investigative protocols.

This report presents all verified data in compliance with current digital asset forensic standards, AML regulations, and best investigative practice for the benefit of compliance professionals, law enforcement, and the financial community at large.
