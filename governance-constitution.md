# L0GIC.io Governance Constitution

**Effective Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Maintainer:** Patrick Crosby  
**Jurisdictional Wrapper:** Marshall Islands DAO LLC (provisional)

---

## 1. Purpose

L0GIC.io exists to expose laundering behavior, crypto scams, and digital asset abuse through semantic forensic intelligence. This constitution defines the governance logic, contributor rights, and voting mechanisms for the project and its DAO wrapper.

---

## 2. Governance Principles

- **Semantic Integrity**: All decisions must preserve the forensic clarity and annotation integrity of the platform.
- **Transparency**: All reports, DAGs, and scoring rubrics are open-source and timestamped.
- **Decentralized Oversight**: Governance is weighted by semantic diversity, not token count alone.

---

## 3. Voting Logic

Votes are weighted using **Entropy-Weighted Voting (EWV)**:
- Each contributor has a base vote
- Additional weight is granted based on:
  - Semantic diversity of contributions
  - Regen score (see scoring rubric)
  - Jurisdictional annotation accuracy

Quorum thresholds are dynamic and entropy-sensitive:
- High-risk decisions (e.g. wallet flagging) require higher entropy diversity
- Low-risk decisions (e.g. UI changes) require standard quorum

---

## 4. Proposal System

Any contributor may submit a proposal. Proposals must include:
- Semantic justification
- Impact analysis
- Regen-weighted support signatures

Proposals are reviewed weekly and voted on via the DAO interface.

---

## 5. Contributor Rights

Contributors earn rights based on semantic impact:
- Voting weight
- Report co-authorship
- DAG annotation privileges
- Regen-based governance tokens (if applicable)

---

## 6. DAO Integration

Upon DAO activation:
- This constitution will be mirrored on-chain
- Regen scores will be tokenized
- Semantic diversity will be enforced via smart contract logic

---

## 7. Amendments

This constitution may be amended via proposal and EWV-based vote. All amendments are timestamped and published publicly.
